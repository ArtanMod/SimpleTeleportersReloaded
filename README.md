With this crystal you can sneak right click a block to create a link at a position you would like to teleport to.


You will now need to craft a "Teleporter" in a crafting table

Place this Teleporter on the ground and use the Ender Crystal you made earlier in it by right clicking with it in your hand. You can freely take the crystal out and put it back in.

Now you have a working teleporter! You can now step on it and sneak to be teleported to the position you linked the crystal to.
